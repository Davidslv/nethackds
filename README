                     NetHackDS -- General Information

HetHackDS is what it sounds like:  a port of the famous game NetHack for the
Nintendo DS.


Building
========

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

In order to build NetHackDS, a number of pre-requisites must be in place:

1. A working devkitpro and devkitARM environment.

2. The following libraries must be installed in $DEVKITPRO/libnds:

  - libnds
  - libfat
  - wifilib
  - libpcre
  - Masscat's gdb stub (specifically, the debug and TCP stubs).  Note, you
    must replace the stock TCP stub with my modified version (the code is
    in sys/nds/tcp_comms).

3. A working build environment for the host machine capable of producing
   32-bit binaries.

Compiling
---------

With the pre-requisites in place, a build can be triggered by running:

make -f sys/nds/Makefile

The game and data files are then available in the binary directory. 


Installing
==========

To install, copy the NetHack data folder to the *root* of your flash device,
and then place the NetHack.nds (or NetHack.ds.gba, if you're using a slot-2
device) in the appropriate location.  Note, you may have to DLDI-patch the
binary if your device doesn't support auto-patching.
